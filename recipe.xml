          Grated parmesan cheese for garnish

		</ingredients>
		<preparation>
			<step>
          Get a large pot of salted water going on the stove top for cooking the linguine and, while that is
coming up to a boil, finely mince 2 Tbs garlic, chop about 1/2 cup fresh parsley and cut 4 cups

broccoli into small florets and then, lastly, cut the boneless, skinless chicken breast meat into
1/2-inch cubes.
        </step>
			<step>
          Season the cubed chicken with salt and pepper and give it a light dusting of all-purpose flour and
then cook it in batches in a deep, heavy bottomed pot in a little olive oil on medium to medium
high heat.
        </step>
			<step>
          Once the water comes to a boil, add the linguine and stir that around to keep it from sticking.
        </step>
			<step>
          Once all of the chicken is lightly browned, and out of the pan and resting on a clean plate, add 3
Tbs butter to the chicken pot, let that melt down. Add the minced garlic and cook that for a
minute or so and then add about 3 cups chicken stock and bring it up to a simmer.
        </step>
			<step>
          Once the stock does come to a simmer, add the broccoli florets and add the chicken back to the
pan.
        </step>
			<step>
          Keep your eye on the linguine and drain that when it's done and, once the broccoli and chicken
are cooked through, add the drained, still hot linguine to that pot, add a little more olive oil, the
chopped parsley, add salt and red pepper flakes to taste and toss to coat.
        </step>
			<step>
          Serve in individual bowls with grated parmesan cheese.
        </step>

            You can make this without the broccoli if you like….but hey, broccoli is a super food!

			<ingredient>
          Olive oil for cooking veggies and sausage
        </ingredient>
			<ingredient amount="1" measurement="cup(s)">
          Canned diced tomatoes
        </ingredient>
			<ingredient>
          Salt and pepper to taste
        </ingredient>
			<ingredient optional="yes">
          Grated parmesan cheese for garnish
        </ingredient>
			<ingredient optional="yes">
          Dollop of basil pesto for garnish
        </ingredient>
		</ingredients>
		<preparation>
			<step>
          Add 4 cups of chicken or vegetable stock and 1 cup of water to a deep, heavy bottomed pot, add
1/2 cup medium grain white rice, bring that up to a simmer and let it cook along without a lid on
top.
        </step>
			<step>
          Once the rice is in the pot, add a splash of olive oil to a large, heavy bottomed soup pot, and cook
the crumbled Italian sausage to brown that up.
        </step>
			<step>
          Then take the sausage out of the pot and add about 3/4 cup of diced onion and 2 medium size,
deseeded and diced zucchini and cook those to soften.
        </step>
			<step>
          Add a little more olive oil to the vegetables if they need it and keep your eye on the rice, you
want it to be just soft to the tooth, itll take about 15 minutes to cook.
        </step>
			<step>
          After a few minutes, when the zucchini is tender crisp, add 1 cup diced canned tomato, add the
sausage back to the pot. Then very carefully add the stock and rice and let it simmer along for a
few minutes, season to taste and it is good to go.
        </step>
			<step>
          Serve it up with a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese and an optional dollop of basil pesto.
        </step>
		</preparation>
		<hints>
			<hint>
            Plan on eating this right away, otherwise the rice will continue to absorb the liquid. Add more
stock or water if you need to.
          </hint>
			<hint>
            Cut the ends off of the zucchini, cut then into quarters lengthwise, carefully slice off the seed
section and continue to cut the quarters into 1/2 cubes.
          </hint>
			<hint>
            Start the sausage at the same time (or before) you get the rice going to make sure the rice isn't
done before the rest.
          </hint>
			<hint>
            Buy basil pesto premade or make your own by pureeing a good handful of basil leaves with a
few walnuts or pinenuts, a small clove of garlic, a bit of grated parmesan cheese and just enough
olive oil to give it a pesto consistency.
